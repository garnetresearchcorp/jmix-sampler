<p>
    <code>SimplePagination</code> can show the total number of records returned by the current query from the container
    without extracting the records themselves. When the user clicks the "?" icon component performs a database query with the
    same conditions as the current query, but using a COUNT(*) aggregate function instead. The number retrieved is
    displayed instead of the "?" icon.
