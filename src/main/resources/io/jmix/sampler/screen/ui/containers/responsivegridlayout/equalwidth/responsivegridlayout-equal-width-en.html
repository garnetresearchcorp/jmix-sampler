<p>You can define columns without explicit values like <code>xs="6"</code>. If cols have no explicit values, then every
    column will be the same width at every breakpoint, from <code>xs</code> to <code>xl</code>. The column width, in
    this case, will be equal to the width of the component divided by the number of columns in the row.</p>
