<p>This version of Gantt chart shows how you can use absolute dates to define start and end for segments, regardless of
    where the other segment in the same category ended.</p>
<p>The config uses <code>startDateField</code> and <code>endDateField</code> to point to a specific fields in segment
    data that hold their start and end dates respectively.</p>
<p>Please note that this demo also takes advantage of <code>brightnessStep</code> setting. It allows increasing
    brightness with each subsequent segment gradually.</p>
