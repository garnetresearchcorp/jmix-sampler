<p>The entire horizontal space of <code>ResponsiveGridLayout</code> is divided into 12 parts of the same width. Each
    column can take one or more parts, and you can define it separately for different screen sizes (or <strong>breakpoints</strong>,
    in Bootstrap terminology). Breakpoints are defined by the <code>xs</code>, <code>sm</code>, <code>md</code>, <code>lg</code>,
    <code>xl</code> attributes and the value of the attribute sets the width of the column in 1/12 parts for this screen
    size.</p>

<p>Below is the correspondence between the breakpoints and the screen size:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>xs</code> - for extra-small screen, with width less than <code>576px</code>. The default value in
        Bootstrap.
    </li>
    <li><code>sm</code> - for small screen, with width between <code>576px</code> and <code>768px</code>.</li>
    <li><code>md</code> - for medium screen, with width between <code>768px</code> and <code>992px</code>.</li>
    <li><code>lg</code> - for large screen, with width between <code>992px</code> and <code>1200px</code>.</li>
    <li><code>xl</code> - for extra-large screen, with width <code>1200px</code> and up.</li>
</ul>
