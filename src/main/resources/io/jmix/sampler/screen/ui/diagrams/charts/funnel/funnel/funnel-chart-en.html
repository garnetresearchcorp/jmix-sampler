<p>Funnel charts are often used to represent stages in a sales process and show the amount of potential revenue for each
    stage. By default, the height of a slice represents it's value. However you might want the area of a slice to
    represent value. The height and width of a neck is controlled by <code>neckWidth</code> and <code>neckHeight</code>
    properties.</p>
