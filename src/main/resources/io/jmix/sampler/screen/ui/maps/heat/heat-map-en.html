<p>The <code>GeoMap</code> UI component allows you to display heat maps.</p>
<p>A heat map overlay is intended to display data density distribution across different geo-points. Data density
    is highlighted with color. By default, regions with higher points density are displayed in red and regions with
    lower density - in green.</p>
