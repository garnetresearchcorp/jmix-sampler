<p>Serial chart supports a lot of graph types: line, area, smoothed line, step, column, candlestick, OHLC. All these
    types can go together in one chart - line with columns, columns with smoothed lines and similar. The real
    difference of these graphs is one property - <code>type</code>, except candlestick and OHLC graphs, of course,
    as they require 4 data fields instead of one.</p>
